# NOAA Sunrise/Sunset Calculations in Python

This is a port of the JS backing NOAA's
[sunrise/sunset tool](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/)

It has been set up for use as a library function, and `calculate()`
returns two datetime objects representing the sunrise and sunset.

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashafer01/noaa_sun.git
cd noaa_sun
python3 setup.py install
```
